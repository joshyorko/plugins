# RCC Router

Use this skill to triage RCC-family tasks. Load the specialist skill that matches the actual work, then continue there.

Treat RCC as the center of gravity for this stack. Frame the domain as RCC-managed contained automation built around `rcc`, `robot.yaml`, holotree environments, work item adapters, and local/CI execution. Keep literal dependency and API names such as `robocorp.tasks`, `robocorp.workitems`, `robocorp-browser`, and `ROBOCORP_HOME` when current code uses them, but treat Robocorp/Sema4.ai references as upstream dependency or interface history unless the task explicitly targets those upstream services or packages. Do not assume upstream Robocorp/Sema4.ai defines new feature direction or active open-source leadership for this stack.

## Route By Task

- Use `$rcc-core` for RCC itself: command selection, install/source orientation, holotree/cache internals, endpoint/profile configuration, templates, bundles, remote cache/client behavior, and failures before a robot task starts.
- Use `$rcc-robots` for RCC-backed automation projects using the `robot.yaml` packaging/runtime convention: `conda.yaml`, environment configs, freeze files, task runtime, templates, artifacts, and task debugging.
- Use `$rcc-robot-framework` for `.robot` suites and resources, Robot CLI/Rebot, custom Robot libraries, results, and RCC `robot_tests` acceptance work.
- Use `$rcc-rpaframework` for `RPA.*` library selection, keyword recipes, package/platform needs, and interoperability with `robocorp.*` libraries.
- Use `$rcc-workitems` for classic `robocorp.workitems`, `actions-work-items`, producer/consumer/reporter flows, local SQLite/file queues, custom adapters, Redis, DocumentDB, and Yorko Control Room adapters.
- Use `$action-server` for ordinary Action Server packages, Josh's actions community branch, `package.yaml` v2, `sema4ai-actions`, `sema4ai-mcp`, OpenAPI/MCP exposure, secrets, dev tasks, action tests, and typed responses.
- Use `$rcc-ci-maintenance` for RCC in GitHub Actions, `ROBOCORP_HOME` cache, pinned RCC install, scheduled maintenance automation, allowlist dependency maintenance, bot PR flows, and CI cache hygiene.

## Router Rules

- Do not keep detailed command recipes in this router. Load one specialist skill and its references.
- If a task crosses boundaries, start with the skill that owns the failing surface. Examples: a failing `rcc ht vars` before suite execution starts belongs to `$rcc-core`; a broken `robot.yaml` environment belongs to `$rcc-robots`; a wrong assertion in `robot_tests/ht_hash.robot` belongs to `$rcc-robot-framework`; choosing `RPA.Tables` versus a Python library belongs to `$rcc-rpaframework`.
- For DocDB-backed RPA systems that mix queue naming, helper scripts, retry, outbox, dashboards, or GitHub Actions matrix workers, start with `$rcc-workitems`; pull in `$rcc-robots` or `$rcc-ci-maintenance` only after the queue boundary is clear.
- Keep canonical edits under `plugins/rcc/skills/<skill>/`. Treat top-level `skills/` and `.agents/skills/` as generated views.
- Do not prototype marketplace servers, MCP servers, web services, daemons, or new runtime products from this plugin. `action-server` covers normal action-package work only.
- When the user explicitly asks to expose Dagger to agents, use `references/dagger-mcp.md` and `scripts/rcc-dagger-mcp`. The installed plugin uses its bundled RCC module by default; use `RCC_DAGGER_REPO` only when the user asks for a different checkout.
- If Docker or Dagger is unavailable, or the task does not need Dagger isolation, use the normal `rcc` binary directly. Start with `$rcc-core` for binary/version/install checks and run `rcc version` or the relevant `rcc ...` command in the active project context.
